Linear Technology LTC 2499 ADC device driver

Required properties:
	- compatible: Must be "ltc,ltc2499";
	- channels: bitmask to enable each channel;
Optional properties:
	- speedmode: either 0(default) or 1
	- prefetchpause: 0 = off(default) no prefetching at all
					[INT] = milliseconds
						the timeout between sampling all channels
	- channels: bitmask to enable which channel in prefetcher

Example:
		ltc2499@16 {
			compatible = "ltc,ltc2499";
			reg = <0x14>;
			status = "okay";
			speedmode = <1>;
			prefetch = <200>;
		};
