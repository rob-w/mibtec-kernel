Device-Tree Bindings for a Counter driver using Omap Timers

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "cnt-gmtimer"
- gpios: one PPS GPIO in the format described by ../gpio/gpio.txt

Optional properties:
- assert-falling-edge: when present, assert is indicated by a falling edge
                       (instead of by a rising edge)

Example:

	cnt_gmtimer {
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&timer6_pin>;

		timer = <&timer6>;

		compatible = "cnt-dmtimer";
		status = "okay";
	};
