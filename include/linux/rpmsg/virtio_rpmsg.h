 * We're allocating buffers of 512 bytes each for communications. The
 * number of buffers will be computed from the number of buffers supported
 * by the vring, upto a maximum of 512 buffers (256 in each direction).
 *
 * Each buffer will have 16 bytes for the msg header and 496 bytes for
 * the payload.
 *
 * This will utilize a maximum total space of 256KB for the buffers.
 *
 * We might also want to add support for user-provided buffers in time.
 * This will allow bigger buffer size flexibility, and can also be used
 * to achieve zero-copy messaging.
 *
 * Note that these numbers are purely a decision of this driver - we
 * can change this without changing anything in the firmware of the remote
 * processor.
